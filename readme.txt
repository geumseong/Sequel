Theme: Sequel

his week’s project was the result of not only a 3-people group (alongside Lenny and Gus), but of all the previous Game-A-Week. 

We decided to make a sequel of Toy Car Sim, a game from the 4th week made by Tobias, Gus and Mark, but set it into space and changed the minigames included, who were originally intended to be previous GAW entries, into new ones, from previous GAW entries.

Such games are: Bawordetsu, BA-Looney, Ka(r)boom, Download a Brain, Hold and Release, Graviry, Space Defence, LSJ episode 1 and Bounce.
Specifically, I focused on Bawordetsu, Graviry and Download a Brain.

Such games had to be re-textured and repurposed to become sci-fi mini-games: Bawordetsu has now a stricter time limit and uses sci-fi terms (Commits 3-10),  Download a Brain is locked on difficulty 2 and uses Spaceships as images (Commits 33-39), and Graviry was entirely re-textured and most code was re-done (Commits 19-20).

Luckily, Toy-Car-Sim was coded by Tobias, so it wasn’t hard to repurpose it.
Furthermore, I added the Trophy System and retextured all the Overworld and the UI (Commits 25-32 and 35-38).

The work was much more connected than in my previous group projects. Everyone had their games to integrate, but we had constant communication and playtests to ensure that every component worked. Naturally this translated into many more hours of work than usual, but as the last project, I didn’t mind crunching.

We didn’t insert the games that were the absolute best, some just didn’t fit in the structure of 2d single player mini-games, so we couldn’t integrate them, but it would be a great endeavour to create a 3d World to explore and where to play to each Game a Week game, organised by author.
